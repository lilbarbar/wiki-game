  <p>Biological classification is how biologists group organisms.</p>

  <p>Biological classification is also known
    as <a href="/wiki/Taxonomy">taxonomy</a>. It is a science, and
    like most sciences has evolved over time. At various times
    different principles were adopted, and it is not rare for
    different scientists to use different methods. Since the early
    20th century, groupings are supposed to fit the Darwinian
    principle of common descent. These days, molecular evolution
    studies, which use DNA sequence analysis as data, are
    popular. This is often called "phylogenetics", a branch or form of
    cladism. This approach creates an evolutionary Tree of life
    (biology) and uses characters (traits) to decide on the branches
    of the taxonomy.</p>
